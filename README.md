## 🔹 How to Install & Run  

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chaitanya-Dev26/Jarvis-Voice-Assistant.git
   cd Jarvis-Voice-Assistant

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install pyautogui SpeechRecognition pyttsx3

2. **Run the Voice Assistant**
   ```bash
   python3 voice_assistant.py

## 🔹 How It Works  

1. The assistant listens to your **voice command**.  
2. It identifies whether you want to **open an app** or **a website**.  
3. If it’s an **app**, it triggers **Spotlight Search** (`Cmd + Space`) and types the app name.  
4. If it’s a **website**, it opens **Chrome** and navigates to the requested URL.  
5. The assistant **keeps asking for the next command** until you say **"Stop"** or **"Exit"**.

## 🔹 Example Commands  

🎙️ Say:  

- `"Open Google"` → Launches **Google Chrome**  
- `"Open YouTube"` → Opens **YouTube in Chrome**  
- `"Open Instagram"` → Opens **Instagram in Chrome**
- `"Open Spotify"` → Launches **Spotify**  
- `"Open WhatsApp"` → Opens **WhatsApp**   
- `"Exit"` or `"Stop"` → **Closes the assistant**
